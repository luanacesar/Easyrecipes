# Easyrecipes

Easy recipes are a web application for healthy recipes meals, snacks, drinks, and desserts. This is a front-end and back-end application. In the front-end, our customers can see all recipes and the corresponding information such as ingredients, category, time to prepare, the chef that published the recipe, and a description of how that the customer should cook the food. Also with the customer click on the chefs on the navigation bar, they going to find more informationâ€™s about the chef like chef name, chef specialty, years of experience, and with is employed of easy recipes team.
To go to the back end area, the admin should sign-in first with a username and password, and if the data is correct the admin can have access to CRUD recipes and CRUD chefs and there is possible to create, edit, add and delete chefs or recipes.
I developed this web application using languages such as HTLM, CSS, C#, .NET CORE MVC, bootstrap, and azure database.
